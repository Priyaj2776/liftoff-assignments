# Project Outline
My Project will be called Hotel Check-in system. This project will help the front desk staff to login onto the web portal and check-in guests, view available rooms, room status, check how many rooms have been sold and at what rate. I intend to use the hotel rates API (if available) that will display rates of hotels in the surrounding area for comparision that will assist staff keep track of their rates too. My app will check-in and check-out a customer and keep track of the room numbers and Date/times the customer checked-in and checked-out.  

My entire family is into Hotel business and they are always struggling when they are out of town or have multiple properties.  I feel this project will help them monitor their business remotely. Anothe radded advantage is that the data will be stored offsite so incase of hardware failure or power outages no data is lost.
